Brian Rivers - Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Portfolio!
Hi there! I'm Brian Rivers, a recent graduate of the TripleTen Data Science course. I created this repository to showcase the diverse set of skills
I have acquired throughout my data science journey. Here, you'll find a collection of projects that highlight my ability to:

- Visualize and analyze data from a variety of sources
- Modify and clean datasets for effective analysis
- Define functions to streamline data operations and processes
- Develop predictive models and conduct machine learning experiments
- Test hypotheses and derive actionable insights
- zEach project in this portfolio represents a real-world problem, with solutions that demonstrate my expertise in Python, data visualization, and machine learning techniques.

I am actively seeking new opportunities in data science where I can apply my skills to solve challenging problems. 
If you're interested in collaborating or want to know more about my work, feel free to explore the repository and connect with me!

Repository Structure:
This repository contains multiple projects, each stored in its own folder. Here is an overview of the key sections you can explore:

- Data Analysis Projects: These projects focus on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), identifying patterns and trends, and visualizing the findings.
- Machine Learning Models: Demonstrates my ability to build, tune, and evaluate machine learning models for regression, classification, and clustering tasks.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Highlights the techniques I use to clean and transform raw data into structured datasets ready for analysis.
- Function Definitions and Automation: Projects that showcase how I use Python functions to automate repetitive data tasks and improve efficiency.
